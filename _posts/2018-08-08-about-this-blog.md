## Motivation for doing this Blog

At some stage we all put a piece of techology down and from time to time and forget(alot of the time for me) the little ways of how certain things are done and work. Therefore it is very important to have it all documented somewhere; to once another day serve as a refreshing primer for all the things we once saw clearly in mind. That is the case for this Blog and all things documented here within.

### Reasons for chosing Jekyll & Simple Texture theme.
This Blog theme(Simple Texture), found [here](https://github.com/yizeng/jekyll-theme-simple-texture), was originally developed and created by [Yi Zeng](https://yizeng.me).

I chose Simple Texture because it fit all of the purposes I was looking for when looking for a Jekyll Blog. Firstly the reason I chose Jekyll was because of its coder friendliness, in terms of everything being editable from my favourite editor Vim and secondly because Jekyll is by. other than that this particular blog theme offered:

1. A simple and neat listings of posts organized by date
2. Categories
3. Tags
4. A cool search that works well 
5. A nice customizable intro cover, where any number of sections can be added
6. Offline editing

All of the above is I think quite well designed and managed by yaml(key-pair values), javascript, liquid templating and markdown is left for the user to manage the blog posts.
